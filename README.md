This project aims to visualize a circuit in a Convolutional Neural Network. I used a pre trained VGG19 model, and selected Block5 Conv1 layer, filter 457. I chose a filter which was present in the downstream because the filters in that section of the model are tasked to identify much finer features as comparedto filters in the upstream. The motive behind this project was to visualize what this selected filter's task was in the Convolutional neural network. This technique helps in visualizing and understanding how does a CNN work, which was considered and treated as a black box earlier.
