This project aims to visualize a circuit in a Convolutional Neural Network. I used a pre trained VGG19 model, and selected Block5 Conv1 layer, filter 457. I chose a filter which was present in the downstream because the filters in that section of the model are tasked to identify much finer features as comparedto filters in the upstream. The motive behind this project was to visualize what this selected filter's task was in the Convolutional neural network. This technique helps in visualizing and understanding how does a CNN work, which was considered and treated as a black box earlier.   

I fed the algorithm with images of different classes and analysed which class of images from the 1000 classes of ImageNet dataset excited it the most. And used gradient ascent technique to create an image which excited the chosen filter the most. I identified that the chosen filter was excited by concave shapes present in an image, like eyes and lips. By doing this project I learned about the architecture of CNN and got in depth knowledge about how it really works.
