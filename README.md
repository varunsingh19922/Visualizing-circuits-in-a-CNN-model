This project aims to visualize a circuit in a Convolutional Neural Network. I used a pre-trained VGG19 model and selected filter 457 in the Block5 Conv1 layer. I chose a filter that was present downstream because the filters in that section of the transformer model are tasked with identifying much finer features in an image compared to filters upstream. The upstream filters are tasked with identifying conspicuous features. The motive behind this project was to visualize the selected filter's function in the Convolutional neural network. This technique helps in visualizing and understanding how a CNN works, which was previously considered and treated as a black box.

I fed the algorithm with images of different classes and analyzed which class of images from the 1000 classes of the ImageNet dataset excited it the most. I used the gradient ascent technique to create an image that excited the chosen filter the most. I identified that the chosen filter was excited by concave shapes present in an image, such as eyes and lips. Through this project, I learned about the architecture of CNNs and gained in-depth knowledge about how they really work.
